### Chapter 1: Introduction

APIs provide an abstraction and functional specification for a component/problem. Can be as small as a single function, or involve hundreds of classes, methods, free functions data types and enumerations.

In c++, they include:
- *.h files
- *.a, *.so library implementations
- documentation

Interfaces are the _most_ important code a developer writes. Whilst encouraging encapsulation and code-reuse; they will be used in unintended ways & tend to live a long time. 

API design is _difficult_ because to encourage code-reuse we often have to generalise beyond that of the initial domain problem space. We can benefit from API design practices for internal code, without paying the additional cost required to design a public API.

As API provides an abstraction over a core piece of functionality, our application code often involves _layers_ of APIs/abstractions:
- base: os specific api such as `fork()`, `getpid()`, `kill()`
- language: `c++ std::`
- networking/boost/graphics
- application

APIs provide communication _contracts_. 

### Chapter 2: Qualities

_A good api should be a joy to use - but also fade into the background_ Henning (2009).

API should be provide a coherent solution for a problem, formulated such that it models the actual domain of the problem. Modelling the _key objects_ of that domain will increase usability as concepts correlate with existing knowledge and experience.

```
struct Order {
  uint64_t id;
  uint64_t price;
  uint32_t quantity;
};

void sendOrder(const Order&) {
}
```

**Good abstractions** 

Providing a high-level, logical abstraction such that a non-technical reader should be able to understands the concepts of the interface and how it is _meant to work_.

Each class with a central purpose, best to offer methods as `actions` rather than `get/set`. Exception to this rule is ADT/POD (Abstract data type) which are simply `struct` with all public members.

**Model key objects**

Objective is to identify the colleciton of major objects, operations they provide and how they relate to one another. Objecdt model should be driven by the API requirements.

**Hide implementation details**

Physical hiding: Declaration vs definition - precise terms with specific meanings in c/c++. To declare provides _type_ information without any _memory_ information. Avoid definitions in headers, and implicit inlining (questionable advice?).

Logical hiding: encapsulation. Users will not _respect_ public API boundary, so do not give them access. A major driver for this is managing [_invariants_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invariant_(mathematics)#Invariants_in_computer_science)

Where possible, remove private methods from your header file(s), by moving them to be `static functions` with a `.cpp` file. This can be done when private members only access public members of a class - Lakos 1996.

_Do_ use nested classes to hide impementation classes.

**Concerns with virtual functions**

- Calls must be resolved at runtime by performing a `vtable lookup`
- Adding, reordering or removing a virtual function will break binary compatibility
- Virtual functions cannot always be inlined

Despite this, if using virtuals:
- always declare destructor as virtual
- never call virtual functions from c'tor/d'tor

**Convenience API**

Can layer minimal API(s) with a convenience API to make it easier to use.

**Difficult to misuse**

Prefer `enum` over `bool`.

```
class Date:
public: 
  Date(Year year, Month month, Day day) {};
};
```

NB: Strong types over `int` for year/month/day. Single c'tor holding invariant of half-initialised date.


**Consistent** 

Below violates principle of least surprise:

```
void *calloc(size_t count, size_t size); // allocates size * count bytes
void *malloc(size_t size); // allocates size bytes
```

Whereas the stl `size()` offers a consistent count of elements across `std::vector`, `std::list`, `std::set` and so forth.

**Orthogonal**

Methods should not have side effects. Calling a method that sets a property should _only_ change that property. This creates a more predictable API.

Orthogonal APIs can be achieved by : reducing redundancy; increasing independence

**Robust resource allocation**

Communicate the `ownership` of allocated objects by return type (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`)

**Reduce class coupling**

When we have a choice, prefer declaring a function as a _non-member, non-friend_ function rather than a member function. This improves encapsulation and reduces coupling.

**Manager classes**

Managers own and coordinate several lower-level classes. This allows dependencies to be _broken_. The `doSelect` function could depend only on a `InputManager` rather than lower-level `MouseInput`, `TableInput` and `JoyStickInput` classes. 

NB: This does **not** require virtualising.

Compare
```
void doSelect() {   // tight coupling between all input types
  if (mouseInput) {
    getMouseXCoord();
  } else if (tableInput) {
    getTableXCoord();
  } else if (joystickInput) {
    getJoystickXCoord();
  }
}
```

To 

```
struct InputManager {
  int GetXCoord();
};
void doSelect(const Input&); // unaware of underlying type
```

**Callbacks, observers, notifications**

General issues to be aware of:
- reentrancy: api calling out to unknown user code, the user code may well call back into API. 
- lifetime management: clients should have a _clean way to disconnect_ and stop receiving updates
- event ordering: sequence of callbacks or notifications should be clear 

Callbacks are pointers to a function within a module A which is passed to module B. They do not have link dependencies and are effective in breaking cyclic dependencies. Sometimes it is useful to provide a 'closure' within the callback function. A closure is a piece of data that module A passes to B, and module B includes in the callback to A. 

_NB: A drawback of C style callbacks is that it is non-trivial to use a non-static (instance) method as a callback. This is due to the `this` pointer of the object also needs to be passed._

Observer patttern has an object maintain a list of dependent objects (observerws) and notifies them by calling one of their methods.

Notifications: generalises the observer pattern through a centralised notificaiton system. Senders do not need to know about receivers beforehand, further reducing the sender-receiver coupling. Signals and slots are a popular notification scheme. Signals are callbacks with multiple targets (slots).

### Chapter 3: Patterns

**Pimpl**

_Pointer To Implementation_ idiom has public classes contain a single private member which is of type `Implementation*` where `Implementation` is forward declared removing the need to `#include "Implementation.h"`. Thus, allowing library developers to hide all implementation detail(s) within a `*.cpp`.

```
class PimplExample {
  public:
  int area() {
     return impl->height() * impl->width();
  }
private:
  class Implementation;
  Implementation* impl;
};
```

Forward declaring the `Implementation` as a private nested class avoids polluting the global namespace with implementation-specific symbols.

NB: Copy & move semantics are affected by pimpl's pointer member. Choices include using a `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to store the Impl, or alternatively deleting the copy and move semantics to avoid a default shallow copying the pointer member.

_Advantages:_ Information hiding, greater binary compatibility size of pimpl'd object never changes. Changes to private member variables only affect the implementation.

_Disadvantages:_ Additional `allocate` and `free` for every object that is created. Extra level of indirection required to access all member variables. Compiler can no longer enfornce `const` member function access of non-const methods as they now live in a separate `Implementation` class.

**Singleton**

Ensure that a class only ever has one instance - providing a global point of access to that instance:

```
struct Service {
  static Service& instance() {
    static Service instance;
    return instance;
  }
private:
  Service() = default;
  ~Service() = default;
  ... // make all special members private
};

// usage
auto& service = Service::instance();
```

We can see in [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8102125/is-local-static-variable-initialization-thread-safe-in-c11) that the standard guarantees thread safety should multiple concurrent threads try and initialise `Service` simultaneously.

**Dependency Injection**

The technique of passing an object into a class (_injected_) instead of having the class create and store the object itself

```
// without DI
struct Strategy {
...
private:
  MarketDataProvider mdp_;
}

// with DI
struct Strategy {
  Strategy(MarketDataProvider*);
private:
  MarketDataProvider* mdp_;
};
```

Dependencies of an object can be substituted in for the purposes of unit testing. i.e. With DI no concrete references of `MarketDataProvider` exist in `Strategy` class, and any object implementing a `MarketDataProviderInterface` can be swapped in.

_NB:_ For performance reasons, if runtime polymorphism is _not_ required, templates can be used to achieve DI at compiletime which is a more performant alternative avoiding the virtual dispatch and indirection.

```
template<typename MDProvider>
struct Strategy {
  Strategy(MDProvider const& mdp): mdp_(mdp) {}
private:
  MDProvider mdp_;
};
```

**Monostate**

Monostate tries to improve upon the `Singleton` pattern by allowing multiple instances of a class to be created, where all of the instances use the same (`static`) data. 

```
struct Monostate {
  int id() { return id++; }
private:
  static int id_;
}

// initialise within monostate.cpp
int Monostate::id_ = 0;
```

This removes the need to call `instance()`, however introduces other idiosyncrasies:

Dynamically allocated members must be initialised within a `static Init()` member or similar (primitives can be generated by the compiler as in the example above)

**Session State**

_"Singletons should only be used to model objects that are truely singular in their nature" - Reddy 2013_

For the majority of cases, introducing a `session` or `execution_context` object early on pays dividends. This allows a single instance to hold all state for your code, rather than representing that state with multiple singletons

```
// Singleton
auto logger = Logger::instance();
auto controller = Controller::instance();

// Session/ExecutionContext

struct Context {
  Logger logger;
  Controller controller;
};
```

This approach protects against mis-use of singletons for concepts not truely singular. Example: `Document` object allows text editors to support multiple windows and call `document->getTextStyle()` vs all documents sharing formatting details.

This approach also makes testing much easier as singletons cannot 'swap' out their implementations.

**Simple Factory**

```
std::unique_ptr<IRenderer> RendererFactory::CreateRenderer(std::string const& type) {
  if (type == "opengl") return std::make_unique<OpenGLRenderer>();
  if (type == "directx") return std::make_unique<DirectXRenderer>();
  if (type == "mesa") return std::make_unique<MesaRenderer>();
  return nullptr;
};
```

Advantages:
- Allows hiding of subclass details (depedencies to opengl, directx, mesa only in \*.cpp file)
- Virtual & runtime creation (not possible w/ c'tors)

Disadvantages:
- Requires extending \*.cpp every time we wish to add support for a new type

**Extensible Factory**

Decouples concrete derived classes from factory method by adding `Register` and `Unregister` functionality. Requires factory to hold state, and results in _almost all extensible factories to be **singletons**_.

```
struct RendererFactory {
  static void RegisterRenderer(std::string const&, CreateCallback); // defers construction to implementation
  static void UnregisterRenderer(std::string const&);
  std::unique_ptr<IRenderer> RendererFactory::CreateRenderer(std::string const&);
private:
  static CallbackMap renderers_;
};

```

**Proxy Pattern**

Provides a one-to-one forwarding interface to another class.

Motivations include: Modifying behaviour of original class whilst preserving interface (e.g. adding thread safety by adding a lock(mutex) wrapper); lazy instantiation; implementing access control; support resource sharing.

2 main approaches: composition or inheritance.

```
// Inheritance

struct Original {
  virtual void doSomething() = 0;
};

class Proxy: public Original {
public:
  void doSomething() override;
};

// Composition

struct Original {
  void doSomething();
};

class Proxy: 
  void doSomething() { orig_->doSomething(); };
private:
  std::unique_ptr<Original> orig_;
};
```

**Adpater Pattern**

Translates the interface for one class into a compatible but different interface. Can be implemented using composition or private inheritance

```
struct RectangleAdapter {
  void set(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    rect_.dimensions(x1,x2,y1,y2);
  }
private:
  Rectangle rect_;
}

// private inheritance
struct RectangleAdapter: private Rectangle {
  void set(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    dimensions(x1,x2,y1,y2);
  }
}
```

**Facade Pattern**

Presents a simplified interface for a larger collection of classes. Defines higher-level interface that makes underlying components easier to use. Encapsulating facades make the underlying classes inaccessible.

Useful for:
- hiding legacy code
- convenience api
- reduced/alternative functionality

**Observer Pattern**

Allows classes to call other classes, while decoupling the components and avoiding cyclic dependancies

Implementations use concept of subject & observer. Observer(s) _register_ with subjects. Subjects do not know the type of the _observers_ only their interface:

```
// Push
struct Observer {
  virtual void update(int) = 0;
};

struct MyObserver: public Observer {
  void update(int) override;
};

struct Subject {
  void subscribe(Observer*);
  void notify() {
    for (auto& o: observers_)
      o.update(...);
  }
};
```

Observers can be _push_ or _pull_ based. Pull based observers trigger a void notification, relying on the observer to interrogate the subject

```
// Pull
struct Observer {
  virtual void update(int) = 0;
};

struct MyObserver: public Observer {
  void update() override;
};

struct Subject {
  void subscribe(Observer*);
  void notify() {
    for (auto& o: observers_)
      o.update();
  }
  int get() { ... }
};
```

The model-view-controller is the most popular use of the observer pattern.

* Model (Subject) - Core application 
* View (Observer) - Gui
* Controller (Links Subject and Observer) - Mediator

_Summary_:

Aim for dependency injection at _lower level_ components. Do consider `SessionState` object(s) like the `Document` rather than having singletons. 

Use singleton pattern sparingly, prefer `Monostate`.

Use factory, builder and singleton at higher level controller objects, allowing for testability and flexibility at lower levels.
